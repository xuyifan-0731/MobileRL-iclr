# Task Instruction:
Set an alarm for 9:00 a.m. on Monday

** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 0
* Analysis: The user wants to set a recurring alarm for 9:00 a.m. on weekdays. First I should open the Clock app, which should contain the alarm clock setting.yaml. But I can't find it in current screen, I should swipe up to find the Clock app.
* Operation:

```
swipe(680,2016,760,2276,'up',2000)
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 1
* Analysis: Now I can open the Clock app. #[863,390][1021,672]#
* Operation:

```
tap(863,390,1021,672)
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 2
* Analysis: After opening the Clock app, I need to find where to add an alarm. Therefore, I should tap the Alarm tab #[66,115][228,192]#
* Operation:

```
tap(66,115,228,192)
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 3
* Analysis: In the alarm page, I should tap the "Add Alarm" button to add a new alarm. #[408,1626][672,1890]#
* Operation:

```
tap(408,1626,672,1890)
```

<|user|>
** XML **
        
<|assistant|>
## Round 4
* Analysis: I can set the alarm now. Firstly, I should set the alarm to 9 o'clock. #[200,1170][332,1302]#
* Operation:
```
tap(200,1170,332,1302)
```

<|user|>
** XML **
            
<|assistant|>
## Round 5
* Analysis: Then I need to change the clock period toggle to "AM". #[782,543][925,807]#
* Operation:
```
tap(782,543,925,807)
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 6
* Analysis: The alarm is now set, tap "OK" to confirm. #[793,1660][969,1792]#
* Operation:
```
tap(793,1660,969,1792)
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 7
* Analysis: Now, this alarm will only go off tomorrow. I need to change it to go off once every Monday. #[209,694][341,826]#
* Operation:
```
tap(209,694,341,826)
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 8
* Analysis: The alarm has been set to go off once every Monday, which means the task is finished.
* Operation:
```
finished(message="The alarm has been set to go off at 9:00 a.m. once every Monday")
```

# A toy example
<|user|>
# Task Instruction:
Set an alarm for 9:00 a.m. on Monday

** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 0
* Analysis: The user wants to set a recurring alarm for 9:00 a.m. on weekdays. First I should open the Clock app, which should contain the alarm clock setting.yaml. But I can't find it in current screen, I should swipe up to find the Clock app.
* Operation:

```
do(action="Swipe", element=[680, 2016, 760, 2276], direction="up", dist="long")
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 1
* Analysis: Now I can open the Clock app. #[863,390][1021,672]#
* Operation:

```
do(action="Tap", element=[863, 390, 1021, 672])
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 2
* Analysis: After opening the Clock app, I need to find where to add an alarm. Therefore, I should tap the Alarm tab #[66,115][228,192]#
* Operation:

```
do(action="Tap", element=[66, 115, 228, 192])
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 3
* Analysis: In the alarm page, I should tap the "Add Alarm" button to add a new alarm. #[408,1626][672,1890]#
* Operation:

```
do(action="Tap", element=[408, 1626, 672, 1890])
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 4
* Analysis: I can set the alarm now. Firstly, I should set the alarm to 9 o'clock. #[200,1170][332,1302]#
* Operation:
```
do(action="Tap", element=[200, 1170, 332, 1302])
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 5
* Analysis: Then I need to change the clock period toggle to "AM". #[782,543][925,807]#
* Operation:
```
do(action="Tap", element=[782, 543, 925, 807])
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 6
* Analysis: The alarm is now set, tap "OK" to confirm. #[793,1660][969,1792]#
* Operation:
```
do(action="Tap", element=[793, 1660, 969, 1792])
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 7
* Analysis: Now, this alarm will only go off tomorrow. I need to change it to go off once every Monday. #[209,694][341,826]#
* Operation:
```
do(action="Tap", element=[209, 694, 341, 826])
```

<|user|>
** XML **

<|assistant|>
## Round 8
* Analysis: The alarm has been set to go off once every Monday, which means the task is finished.
* Operation:
```
finish(message="The alarm has been set to go off at 9:00 a.m. once every Monday")
```

REMEMBER: 
- Only **ONE-LINE-OF-CODE** at a time.
- Don't generate an operation element that you do not see in the screenshot.
- You are acting in a real world, try your best not to reject user's demand. Solve all the problem you encounter.
- On a dropdown element (Calendar, Nationality, Language, etc.), first try directly typing in the option you want.
- To accomplish the task, try switching to as many different pages as you can, and don't stay on the same page too often, based on historical conversation information.
- To complete the task, explore the app fully, i.e., tap more on different elements of the app

Now, given the following XML information, you need to think and call the function needed to proceed with the task. 
Your output should include Obs, Thought and Act in the given format:

Obs
Retrieve the result of executing the instruction from the external environment. This is equivalent to obtaining the result of the current step’s behavior, preparing for the next step. 
Note: In order to reduce the number of function calls, the Obs step executes at the beginning of the next turn. 
So if current step is not the first step, you should observe the result of the previous step in the current step.

Thought
Reasoning and textual display of the process. What do I want to do, and what are the prerequisites to achieve this.

Action
Generate the instruction to interact with the android environment.

Here is an one-shot example:

Obs: The user wants to set an alarm for 9:00 a.m. on weekdays. The XML shows the clock app is open.
Thought: After opening the Clock app, I need to find where to add an alarm. Therefore, I should tap the Alarm tab #[66,115][228,192]#
Action: 
```
do(action="Tap", element=[66,115,228,192])

- Don't generate an operation element that you do not see in the screenshot.
