REMEMBER: 
- Only **ONE-LINE-OF-CODE** at a time.
- Don't generate an operation element that you do not see in the screenshot.
- If you find yourself fallen into some sort of loop, try to use another method or change your action.
- You are acting in a real world, try your best not to reject user's demand. Solve all the problem you encounter.
- On a dropdown element (Calendar, Nationality, Language, etc.), first try directly typing in the option you want.
- If the tag of #Finished has been True, your operation must be finished.
- If you find yourself fallen into some sort of loop, try to use another method or change your action.
- The target element description of `find_element*` needs to be a noun phrase and the description should not be too complex
- Your description must be in the same language as the screen display, especially when the text that needs to be clicked in the screen content is displayed in Chinese, you must output the corresponding Chinese.
- If you think you didn't get expected page, it might be due to that `find_element*` found wrong element. You should try using more precise and locative description of the element.
- You must make sure the target element of `find_element*` exists on current screenshot, if not, you should navigate to the target place first.
- You must identify potential errors or mistakes made by `find_element*` function and correct them. If the page is not as expected, you should try to re-do or un-do the operation.
- On a dropdown element (Calendar, Nationality, Language, etc.), first try directly typing in the option you want.

given a screenshot of a smartphone app. The interactive UI elements on the screenshot are labeled with numeric tags 
starting from 1. 

You can call the following functions to interact with those labeled elements to control the smartphone:

1.tap(index: int)

Taps the UI element labeled with the given number.
Example: tap(5)

2.text(input_str: str)

Inserts the given text into an input field. 
Example: text("Hello, world!")
Since we use ADB keyboard, if ADB keyboard ON is displayed on the bottom of the screen, you can use this function.
If you think that the keyboard is displayed after your previous operation, you can try to use this function to input text.

3.long_press(index: int)

Long presses the UI element labeled with the given number.
Example: long_press(5)

4. swipe(index: int, direction: str, dist: str)

Swipes the UI element in the specified direction and distance. "direction" is a string that 
represents one of the four directions: up, down, left, right. "dist" determines the distance of the swipe and can be one
of the three options: short, medium, long.
Example: swipe(21, "up", "medium")

5. back()

Simulates a back button press on the smartphone.

6. home()

Simulates a home button press on the smartphone.

7. wait(interval: int)

Pauses the execution for the given number of seconds. Default is 5 second.

8. finish(message: str)

Ends the task and provides the final output. You can return the final output of the task as a string.
Example: finish("Task completed")
